# pyrust-pyi-generator

simple script to generate basic pyi documentation for a pyo3 rust module. Currently only works for functions.

* converts rust function signature to its python equivalent
* Automatically converts some basic types into python equivalents.
* Rust docstrings converted to python docstrings


maturin can handle this already, much better than this script can, but it was a fun project for learning more about regex
